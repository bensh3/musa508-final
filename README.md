# Northeast Corridor delay methodology

## Data collection

- Kaggle
- GTFS
- riem weather
- NJT train cancellations by month

## Data processing

- Give each station a defined sequence ID number
- Filter for non-NA, for complete trips, year 2019
- Categorize trains by period of day
- Categorize into small delay and big delay

## Data visualization

## Feature engineering

- Create feature for known bottleneck (interlocking, speed limit)
- Time lag
- Period of day
- Weather

## Modeling

- Model delay by station
- Model delay by train

## Analysis
